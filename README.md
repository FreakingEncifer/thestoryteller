# The StoryTeller

I had perceived this idea while writing an SOP to participate in a Google's event.
At that time it was not clear how this could be implemented and is not yet clear. 
But the main aim was to "Tell stories to the specially abled people".
Basically the machine would view the world from the normal person's perspective but narrate it in the specially abled person's perspective.

### Key sub-problems to solve
1. Computer Vision: Image segmentation/localization/object detection
2. NLU: Describe the objects/actions etc. in the scene.
